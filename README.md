# CorCA
CORrection of C Automatically

CorCA is a tool that applies code correction to fix the vulnerable C/C++ code of an application, confirming the existence of the flaws and testing the new (fixed) code. The tool employs static analysis to find various types of buffer overflow (BO) vulnerabilities, attack injection techniques to confirm the vulnerabilities found, validate the fixed code,and fix the code automatically with dynamically generated fixes.
